WELCOME TO THE DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS MADE IN JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!
The first file (Main.java) tackles the usage of Stack in Data Structures.
Simply put, Stacks are a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Key Operations of a Stack:
1. push() – Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. pop() – Removes the element at the top of the stack.
3. peek() – Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty() – Checks if the stack is empty.
